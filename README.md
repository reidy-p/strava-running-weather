TODO
---
* Top 10 activities with the biggest discrepancies between actual speed and adjusted speed
* Do something about rate limits? Only update those activities that are not already there? (use after certain date that is read in) 
* Command line argument to collect versus analyse
* Write out as JSON?
* Adjusting pacing depending on wind (maybe too hard because of direction)
* Use richer python types for quantities rather than the simple string or numeric values that the Strava API returns or the simple quantities that stravalib returns
* Grouping similar activities. Is this done already or is it something I could do?
